Automatic image colorization, which means colors greylevel
images, has been a hot field due to its valuable applications
like old-paragraph colorization. Traditionally, this
work needs people to set color value to each pixel. Hopefully,
deep learning can provide tremendous convenience to
image colorization. For instance, Iizuka (Iizuka, Simo-Serra,
and Ishikawa 2016) proposed a fully automatic image colorization
based on Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) in
an end-to-end fashion. Isola et al. (Isola et al. 2017) introduced
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to image
translation, including image colorization. Usually, a deeplearning
model predicts a color value to each pixel of the
grayscale image.

This work is to implement the above two approachs and make comparsion.
